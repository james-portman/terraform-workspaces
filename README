Workspace testing/example

Workspace commands:

terraform workspace list
terraform workspace new [workspace name]
terraform workspace select [workspace name]

The current workspace is available as ${terraform.workspace}

Need to test the idea about merging dev and prod, but should work fine as long as you are in the right workspace and using the right aws creds surely??
(or aws-profile etc)


= Running

So to run there are some differences, dev example:

$ terraform workspace select development
$ terraform plan -var-file=development.tfvars




Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + aws_s3_bucket.some_s3_bucket
      id:                          <computed>
      acceleration_status:         <computed>
      acl:                         "public"
      arn:                         <computed>
      bucket:                      "development-s3-bucket-for-me"
      bucket_domain_name:          <computed>
      bucket_regional_domain_name: <computed>
      force_destroy:               "false"
      hosted_zone_id:              <computed>
      region:                      <computed>
      request_payer:               <computed>
      tags.%:                      "1"
      tags.Name:                   "development-s3-bucket-for-me"
      versioning.#:                <computed>
      website_domain:              <computed>
      website_endpoint:            <computed>


Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
